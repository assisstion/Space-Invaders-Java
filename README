Hit Streak Rewards Explanation:
Hit sprees form an integral part of the game. By repeatedly striking an enemy without
missing/hitting a bunker/getting hit, you will have a chance to get a reward!
The better the reward, the larger the hitstreak required to redeem it is. After meeting the requirements
for a hitstreak, the top box will turn GREEN! Press R to redeem the powerup as written. However, note that
the requirement in the box will have changed! This means that you can continue shooting to get the next reward.
But if you miss, you will lose everything, and your hitstreak will return to 0. If you redeem, your hitspree
will also reset to 0.



Note: Easter Eggs MAY be present
